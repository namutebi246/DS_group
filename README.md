### **Assignment 4**

**Quadratic Time Complexity**

**Task:**  
Derive the program steps for a quadratic time complexity algorithm.

The file can be found in [`Assignment_4`](Algorithms/quadratic_algorithm.txt).

**Please click here to expand**
üëá

<details>
  <summary>Quadratic Time Complexity (O(n¬≤))</summary>
  
  **Quadratic time complexity O(n¬≤)** occurs when an algorithm's execution time grows proportionally to the square of the input size (n). This often happens in algorithms that involve nested loops, where each element is compared or processed multiple times.

  ### Example: Bubble Sort Algorithm

  To illustrate O(n¬≤) complexity, consider Bubble Sort, which sorts an array by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.

  #### Steps of the Bubble Sort Algorithm:
  
  1. Start with an unsorted array of size n.
  2. Loop through the array (i = 0 to n-1) to ensure all elements are sorted.
  3. For each pass, compare adjacent elements (j = 0 to n-i-1):
     - If `arr[j] > arr[j+1]`, swap them.
  4. Repeat until no swaps are needed, meaning the array is sorted.

  #### Pseudocode for Bubble Sort:

  ```text
  Function BubbleSort(arr[], n):
      For i from 0 to n-1:
          For j from 0 to n-i-1:
              If arr[j] > arr[j+1]: 
                  Swap arr[j] and arr[j+1]
      End Function
  ```

## Program #1: Algorithm for Directly Using an Element in an Array

### Algorithm:

1. **START**
2. Declare a fixed-size array.
3. Ask the user to input the first element.
4. Retrieve and print the first element.
5. **END**

### Program Steps for Algorithm 1:

| Step | Operation                         | Count |
|------|-----------------------------------|-------|
| 1    | Declare array (int arr[1])        | 1     |
| 2    | Print message (printf)            | 1     |
| 3    | User input (scanf)                | 1     |
| 4    | Function call (firstElement(arr)) | 1     |
| 5    | Access & print arr[0]             | 1     |
| **Total** |                               | **5** |

### Analysis for User-Input-Based First Element Retrieval:
- Directly accessing `arr[0]` always takes the same time regardless of user input.
- User input is a single operation that does not grow with `n`.
- **Time Complexity**: O(1).

1. **START**
2. Ask the user to enter the size of the array `n`.
3. If `n == 0`, print "Array is empty" and exit.
4. Declare an array `arr[n]`.
5. Ask the user to input `n` elements, storing them in `arr`.
6. Initialize `sum = 0`.
7. Loop through the array and add each element to `sum`.
8. Print the total sum.
9. **END**

### Program Steps for Algorithm 2 (Linear time complexity):

| Step | Operation                                | Count |
|------|------------------------------------------|-------|

| 5    | Print "Array is empty" if `n == 0`       | 1     |
| 6    | Declare array `arr[n]`                   | 1     |
| 7    | Print "Enter elements"                   | 1     |
| 8    | Loop for user input (for loop)           | n     |
| 9    | Declare sum                              | 1     |
| 10   | Loop for sum calculation (for loop)      | n     |
| 11   | Print final sum                          | 1     |
| **Total** |                                    | **8 + 2n** |

### Analysis for Finding the Sum of Elements in an Array:
- The sum requires visiting each element once.
- We must use a loop to iterate through all elements, making it O(n).
- **Time Complexity**: O(n).

5. Ask the user to input `n` elements, storing them in `arr`.
6. Loop through the array.
   - For each element, loop through the remaining elements.
   - Print all possible pairs.
7. **END**

### Program Steps for Algorithm 3 (Quadratic time complexity):

| Step | Operation                                                 | Count      |
|------|-----------------------------------------------------------|------------|

| 5    | Print "Not enough elements" (if applicable)               | 1          |
| 6    | Declare array `arr[n]`                                    | 1          |
| 7    | Print "Enter elements"                                    | 1          |

### Analysis for Finding All Pairs in an Array:
- The nested loop forms all pairs.

## Program #4: Algorithm to Perform Binary Search on a Sorted Array

### Algorithm:

1. **START**
2. Ask the user to enter the size of the array `n`.
3. If `n == 0`, print "Array is empty" and exit.
4. Declare an array `arr[n]`.
5. Ask the user to enter `n` sorted elements.
6. Ask the user to input the target value to search for.
7. Perform binary search:
   - Initialize `low = 0`, `high = n-1`.
   - Repeat while `low <= high`:
     - Compute `mid = (low + high) / 2`.
     - If `arr[mid] == target`, print "Found" and exit.
     - If `arr[mid] < target`, set `low = mid + 1`.
     - If `arr[mid] > target`, set `high = mid - 1`.
8. If not found, print "Element not found".
9. **END**

### Program Steps for Algorithm 4 (Logarithmic time complexity):

| Step  | Operation                                    | Count       |

| 5     | Print "Array is empty" (if applicable)       | 1           |
| 6     | Declare array `arr[n]`                       | 1           |
| 7     | Print "Enter sorted elements"                | 1           |

| 9     | Print "Enter search element"                 | 1           |
| 10    | User input for search target                 | 1           |
| 11    | Binary search loop (halving each iteration)  | log2(n)     |
| 12    | Check `arr[mid] == target` (inside loop)     | log2(n)     |
| 13    | Update `low` or `high`                       | log2(n)     |
| 14    | Print result                                 | 1           |
| **Total** |                                           | **O(log n)** |

### Analysis for Binary Search:
- Binary search halves the search space each time.
- The number of times the loop runs is at most `log‚ÇÇ(n)`.
- **Time Complexity**: O(log n).

### Conclusion:
This README outlines the algorithms used, the steps involved, and their respective time complexities. Each program demonstrates how different algorithms operate and the impact of input size on execution time. The time complexities range from constant time (O(1)) to quadratic time (O(n¬≤)), providing a clear example of different algorithmic performance.
